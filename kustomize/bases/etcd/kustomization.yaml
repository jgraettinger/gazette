# Etcd deploys Etcd as a StatefulSet backed by PersistentVolumeClaims for durability.
#
# MIN_REPLICAS defines the "seed" size of the cluster, and the StatefulSet
# expects to always run with at least that many replicas. More replicas may
# be added by scaling the StatefulSet, and each new replica will dynamically
# join (or leave) the cluster on scale-up (or down). It's recommended to
# scale by one member at a time.
